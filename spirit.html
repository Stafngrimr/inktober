        <p>The Spirit of the Forest are many, it seems at first, but they are really
          just one being. If you speak with one, you've spoken with any of them really.
          They are hidden away in the trees and in the leaves; in the earth and in
          the roots; in the deep shadows and in the bright lights above.</p>
        <p>You might spot one, now and again, or you might spot movement in your peripheral
          vision causing you to stop and turn. You probably missed whatever it was,
          you might think to yourself, it was just the wind or a bird or something.
          They don't stay out for just anyone.</p>
        <p>But if you're lucky, you might turn around to spot him staring back at you,
          totally still and silent. If you're luckier still, you might see another
          lurch around a tree trunk, and yet another pop out from behind a bush.
          Keep still enough after that, and you might see the light forming behind
          them. I've absolutely no idea what's in there but it's got to lead to
          something interesting, right?
