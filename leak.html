        <p>Up plug holes and down taps he can crawl, working his way through your
          plumbing and the cracks in your foundations. He can, by force of will alone,
          make himself as tiny as a amoeba or as big as a giraffe and no matter his
          size he's always as quiet as a mouse.</p>
       <p>You may notice something has been moved since last night, or had lost something
         that you were completely sure that you had left it in the same spot you
         always leave it before bed. You'll convince yourself that you must have
         done something else because you were feeling a bit funny anyway, or you'd
         had an extra glass of wine. Perhaps your spouse or children moved it as a
         game or a prank?</p>
      <p>He'll never take anything of strong emotional or physical value.. so as not
        to cause too much alarm. You'll notice things are gone and then when you don't
        find them you'll soon give up and just buy a new one.. you don't need to worry 
        too much about it do you?
