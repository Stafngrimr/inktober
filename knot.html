        <p>He just had a thing about knots. Ever since he was a kid, he enjoyed tying
          knots. He'd pick up a piece of rope, or string, or lace and just tie it
          around itself over and over again.</p>
        <p>Even as he grew up and didn't show much interest in anything else. He
          was a quiet boy, didn't get into trouble but didn't seem to mingle enough
          with the other kids either. He wasn't the sharpest pencil in the drawer,
          but it always seemed to mainly be that his main focus in life was to tie
          knots and nothing else could pull him away for too long from that fascination.</p>
        <p>Well, when the old town hangman died, it just seemed too good a fit to not
          go for it. He is always prepared and always does his duty with absolute
          focus and a steady hand.</p>
        <p>He's been asked to wear the mask, to hide the smile on his face as he works.
