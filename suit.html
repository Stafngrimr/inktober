        <p><strong>5th April 1885</strong> - The London apartment of Prof. Dick R. Robertson was 
          broken into over the weekend. Against the Professor's wishes one of his
          kindly neighbours alerted the authorities, which lead to a more grave
          discovery than that of a minor larceny.</p>
	     <p>When questioning the Professor and searching the apartment for clues, the
         constabulary found evidence of a secret laboratory into which they decided
         to check on account of the Professor's suspicious behaviour. A creature was
         found, appearing to be from the sea, wired into a suit made from metal plates
         and wires. The police inmediately blocked all access to the area but an image
         has surfaced, which you find attached to the article.</p>
	    <p>The poor creature appears to be a cephalopod coerced into a state of hypnosis,
        through the use of modern technology. The globe upon it's head is filled with some
        kind of dark matter, projecting an image of space into it's mind. Reports say the
        creature moved upright within the suit, but moved slowly and without appearing to
        be aware of it's actual surroundings..
