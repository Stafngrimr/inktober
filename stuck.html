        <p>She had stood for decades on that god forsaken rock. She'd seen
          storms the likes of which you couldn't even dream up. Withstood countless
          jabs from salty sea fists, leaving her wood and paint pockmarked and bruised, but still
          she stood strong. Nothing god could throw at her would knock her down, and
          she did her duty year after year, keeping the lives of hundreds of sailors
          safe with her fair warning.</p>
        <p>Nobody could have foreseen the accident that befell those keepers that year.
          It was a freak accident that they could never have prepared for. How could they?
          It wasn't in the manual and it sure as hell wasn't a story that even the
          grimmest sailor or keeper could have passed down to them. Happen it did though.</p>
        <p>Today she still stands tall and proud, and she still saves hundreds upon
          hundreds of lives, year after year.</p>
        <p>But no one mans her. No man, that is.
