        <p>He watches over the town as it gets ready for bed. Each person so small
          from atop his tower, finishing off their day and getting ready to cosy
          up near loved ones and sleep.</p>
       <p>But he's not really that interested in those whose day is going to end
         peacefully. He made these goggles to be able to see the small details,
         the fear in people's eyes, the bad men skulking in the shadows. He is waiting
         for someone to misbehave, so he can rush to their rescue. He's been up in
         this tower ever since he was small dreaming of being a hero, dreaming of
         the day he could prove himself to all below as their saviour.</p>
       <p>But the town doesn't go through that many crises. It's a quiet, sleepy town,
         filled with people who cherish and respect each other. So he watches, and
         he waits.
