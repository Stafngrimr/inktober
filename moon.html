        <p>The Moon has always seemed such a beautiful place, far away in the stars,
          but close enough to see it's contours and it's energy. For millenia people
          have looked up and been inspired by it's light, shining down upon us, as
          the signal to let us know that everything will be fine this night and that
          we should lay our heads upon our pillows.</p>
       <p>The truth though, is that this is a trick. The moon wants you to sleep. It
         wants you to dream, because all creatures in this universe require feeding.
         The moon feeds on the dreams of the sleeping and if you've ever heard of a person
         not waking up from their sleep it's because the moon took too much.. it
         devoured their souls completely and there was nothing left to come back down
         to earth.
