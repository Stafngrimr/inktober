        <p>She would come back from work every night and spend the twilight hours
          of the day with her needle and thread, adding new patches to the coat. Her
          attitude towards the job was quite frantic, but her patience and diligence
          with the thread was calm and efficient. Each patch had it's exact place
          and each had been carefully sourced and measured, like a game of tetris.</p>
       <p>When she had started the project it was just a bit of fun. Something innocuous
          to do in the evenings that would result in something great to show off when
          going out. However, that was 3 jackets ago, and now it had become something
          of an obsession. She had to have something new to show off, and each had
          to be bigger, bolder and ever the more impressive.</p>
       <p>This would be the last, for sure. She said that last time, but this time
          For Sure. It had to be, she had stopped going to see friends or even going
          out to a gig to enjoy it, rather than walk up and down in her coat wondering
          what people were thinking of saying about it.</p>
       <p>Definitely the last.. although, I do have a few spare patches still lying
          around from the market that need to go on something..
