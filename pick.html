        <p>It was given to him on his 10th birthday. Every child in the settlement
          was given their first pick on their 10th birthday, it was tradition. His mother
          was against it, he knew, but his dad was adamant that traditions must be upheld.
          What he wasn't expecting was the beautiful curves of the wooden handle, or
          the beautiful shine on the  metal of the pick. He fell in love instantly.</p>
        <p>Feels like a long time ago now though. He looked down at that same pick in his hands and
          saw all the extra notches along the handle, both from action and from age. Still
          worked a treat though. When he swung it, he could always feel just as much
          power as when he swung it for the first time all those years ago. Now though,
          each swing had a purpose. Each swing was made in the protection of those in
          need of his help. Each swing was made against the perpetrators of injustice
          in the settlement, and every swing between now and his last would remain that
          way. He didn't think of himself as a hero, but he knew that others did. It
          didn't really matter, but it helped to have good PR when you had this much
          blood on your pick.
