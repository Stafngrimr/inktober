        <p>Come to the Turtle Shop! We have everything for sale and all are welcome!
          The only trick is finding us, for the Great Turtle moves slowly but surely
          up and down the Pacific Ocean.</p>
       <p>The shop has been here for hundreds of years, built by my ancestors and
         passed down father to son, father to daughter, daughter, to sister, generation
         by generation. We have food and rare items that you won't see anywhere else..
         items hidden by the ocean but retrived by our oldest friend, the Great Turtle.
         The story as to how my family came to befriend such a magnificent creature
         sounds so fantastical that it is difficult to believe that a little bit
         of embellishment has not occured as it is passed down the ages.</p>
       <p>The Turtle was a younger being when he came across my
        great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandmother and
        grandfather. They were adrift at sea, the lost parts of a voyage crossing
        the Pacific that must have befallen a terrible accident. The Turtle swam
        beneath them and rose them above the ocean's water so they could recover
        their breath and their strength, before slowly swimming them to land. Once
        there, they were so grateful they befriended, fed and lived with the Turtle,
        creating a new home and watching him grow. The Turtle grew larger and larger,
        and the food sources on the island they had inhabited became more scarce as
        the months went by.</p>
       <p>From then on, the then Great Turtle would swim them to different lands in the
       search for foods, and materials and still continued to grow. As the years went
       on, and as children were added to the family, the Turtle's shell became inhabited
       fully and eventually the Turtle Shop was born.
