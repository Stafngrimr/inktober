        <p>Known as the Helmet for it's unique and distinctive design, he was feared
          and admired throughout the kingdom. Never seen not by the side of his
          princess, he was a mountain of a man, especially in contrast to his charge,
          towering over all who approached. No one but his princess ever heard him
          speak; he would issue most commands with a look, and expect his subordinates
          to carry them out without questions.</p>
       <p>He would never socialise, never marry, No beer touched his lips, nor did the
         smoke of any tobacco fill his lungs. He was devout to his role, to the point
         of madness, though none of his movements or actions would give him away as
         such. It was only in those moments alone, when he would ready himself for
         sleep, and remove his steel and heavy helmet, that he would allow himself a moment
         to think about life. A man devoted to one cause, and never allowing
         himself a moment's hestitation, he would reflect on the possibilities he
         may have missed.</p>
      <p>You only get to to live your life once, and he had made his choice. Before
        laying down in his bed his resolution would harden and his determination to
        see things through would be complete. He'd sleep a dreamless sleep, impatient
        to begin the next day.
