        <p>Experiment-C was a mistake that happened after a late night conversation
          surrounding the mythical creatures of old. Myself and Doctors Carlton and
          Edwards would often end days with a brandy and rousing discussion of
          some description. Though this night what came to mind were the harpy, the gryphon,
          the dreaded manticore.. what wonderful imagination these myths sparked
          and at first just for some fun.</p>
       <p>Though the discussion turned serious and technical as the brandy flowed and
         the hours drifted away. How would it even be possible? It seemed so far
         fetched and ridiculous at first, but the more discussion was had the more
         answers we'd discover to questions that no longer seemed insurmountable.</p>
      <p>It was the very next day that we sat to discuss further, in the sobering
        light of day to discover that not only did our answers still work, but the
        number of unanswered questions dwindled to almost nothing. I wish we hadn't
        felt so inspired by this and stopped to think of the consequences. Now experiment-C
        has escpaed, experiment-E is in the ground and I find myself the only one left
        staring at what the pieces of my colleagues I couldn't use.
