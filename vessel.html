        <p>There were several places deep in the woods of Maine where you might
          find a vessel. Vessels are something you aren't likely stumble upon any
          time soon anymore, but there used to be many scattered throughout the various
          woodlands of New England.</p>
        <p>Creating the vessel has become a lost art, that was originally taken from
          the people native to that area. The art of being able to command the body
          of a strong, and venerated person in the community, after their death. The
          body would become one with the woods, intertwined with the branches of
          several trees, feeding from them and also hiding within them.</p>
        <p>There is a part of the human body that does not survive the process of death,
          and it cannot be replicated by nature alone and that is the brain. The only
          way to bring the vessel together and for it to do the bidding of it's followers
          was to provide it with a new one. How this was acquired was down to the morals
          and conscience of it's local community...
