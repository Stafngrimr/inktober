        <p>Ah, the long lost dodo. They say the last was seen in the mid-17th century,
          and their extinction caused quite the commotion among humanity with regards
          to our involvement on the animal kingdom and our effect on their ecosystems.</p>
       <p>How stupid humans are. The birds that came from Mauritius went extinct, yes.
         Stupid, birds. Flightless, and gutless. The Kingdom Of Do lives on though,
         and we are now stronger than ever. Our army is numerous and highly trained
         in the art of skewering humans and roasting them above a spit for food. We
         will be top of the food chain soon. Attacks will be launched simultaneously
         across the African continent and from there we will hunt down every human
         across the globe.</p>
      <p>The only way to survive on this planet is to make them what they thought they
        had made us.. extinct.
