        <p>In a place, known to some, but feared by many more there was the Compass.
          It marked a place between arid lands and tumultuous seas, between unending
          mountains and bottomless canyons. It occupied a place at the intersection
          of dimensions and kept together the fabric of space and time.</p>
       <p>All worlds were beholden to it, and most would never learn of it's existence,
         let alone it's location. The Compass created and destroyed. It would direct
         the beginnings of new life and new worlds, and it would be the end of the
         old, and eat those at the end of their cycle.</p>
      <p>All mortals believe in a higher being at some stage of their development,
        but most project their own images or the images of those creatures they most
        admire onto them. It was only at the the point before extinction that the
        veil would be lifted and reality would face them. The monolithic Compass
        would rise in front of them and they would see it's teeth rise further still,
        opening the black hole leading to the end of times.</p>
     <p>Life is a cycle.
