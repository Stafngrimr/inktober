        <p>He was determined to be the best. The champion. The most daring, brave
          and sexually desired skeleton in all the world. He'd have his boney profile in every
          magazine around the world and everybody would be talking about him around
          the graveyard.</p>
       <p>He revved his engine with excitement as he looked ahead of him at the task at
         hand. The tarmac hot and glistening in the summer heat leading to the enormous loop
         in front of him, heaving upwards in a way that was disorienting. The entire
         road twirled in on itself and was held together by huge metal struts on all
         sides, like giant scaffolding. It had been tested thoroughly, and as long as
         he reached the required speed at the crucial point, he'd make it.</p>
      <p>He revved some more and felt the moment coming nearer and nearer. He put an
        arm out of his window like a composer letting his crowd know the first note
        of his magnum opus was about to be played. The crowd roared with excitement and
        not a small amount of bonelust and this was all the starting gun he needed to
        put his foot and speed towards the loop that would propel him to fame and fortune.
