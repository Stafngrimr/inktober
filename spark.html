        <p>Life is actually very complicated. It works on many different planets
          across many different universes and the most basic building blocks are
          the same, but the proportion of each block and then the ingredients on
          top make huge differences as to the survival of one species against
          another.</p>
       <p>Then you have to worry about the ecosystem of different species working
          together and making sure that they balane each other nicely. The right amount
          of predators and prey, the right amount of flora and fauna, the right amount
          of everything in between. Some planets just manage this by luck, by the
          thousand monkeys typing out millions of millenia of rubbish to produce
          the masterpiece of life.</p>
       <p>Some planets need a spark. A spark of hope, a spark of love, a spark of
          intelligence to put the pieces together in the right place and make sure
          that life does find a way, whether it likes it or not. Does that make me
          a creator?
