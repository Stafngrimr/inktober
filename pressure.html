        <p>It's always on a cycle that goes between everything's probably going to be fine, to things
          are really piling up, to holy shit I think I'm really far behind this time. And
          round and round that goes, bouncing between each feeling on a daily basis. It's
          too much, I really need to quit and find something else. But no, I should find
          something else first, then quit. I can't do that though, I don't have time to
          be looking for something else, and great, whilst I'm thinking about this I'm falling even
          further behind.</p>
        <p>Alright, take a second and take stock of what you have left to do, and how
          long do I have left today to get it done in? Alright, that's not great, but
          if I can at least cross this off, and this off then I can leave this for the
          morning. Or I could ask them to do that to help me out, but I really don't
          want to have to do that again. They already helped me out yesterday and I
          know they don't mind, but I really hate asking.</p>
        <p>Whatever, just get started on the first one. The more you sit here and strategize
          the more time is ticking by with nothing getting further along. I feel agitated
          though; I'm going to make some tea, or go for a walk to calm down maybe. Then
          I'll definitely get started on finding something else so I can quit...
