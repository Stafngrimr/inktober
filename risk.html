        <p>We got the idea from that movie with Tom Hanks? You know, where there's
          that machine and he makes a wish and then he's all big.</p>
       <p>Well, it's a different time now and people are always worried about the
          decisions they make in life, so we wanted to do something a bit fun that
          reflected that modern world and all. So that's how we came up with Eros.
          The name is a bit of a mismatch from the original character of Eros from
          greek mythology, we just thought it sounded good altogether. Took us years
          to write the programming, but once we had that part together, the hardware
          was easy and really the fun bit.</p>
       <p>I know that people say it's a bit much, but we still think it's cool. The
          idea was never to always give people the answers they wanted to hear, it was
          to give them something fun to take back. People take things way too seriously
          these days. I mean, it's in a theme park! It's not meant to be something people
          actually base their decisions on in life!
