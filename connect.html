        <p>He couldn't believe what he was seeing.</p>
        <p>A few minutes ago, he was just walking down the street and and just happened
          to turn to glance at and into the window of a house. He saw an arm moving
          slowly and rather oddly towards a computer and then the fingers detached
          and cables came out, gliding across the air. It stopped him dead in his
          tracks and he didn't move for a moment, as he watched the cables extend
          from the hand and slither towards the pc before hooking themselves into
          it.</p>
       <p>He regained some control of his legs and slowly moved towards the window,
         noticing that actually at the other end of the arm, there was no upper arm
         and no torso. There was in fact, no human parts at all attached, and in their
         place some plastic tubing that lead down to below the bottom of the window,
         out of his sight. He moved forwards slowly some more, before it was revealed
         that a small mouse on a tiny laptop, was hooked into this contraption and
         appeared to be hacking into computer. This was equally, the most ridiculous,
         unbelievable and strangely adorable thing he'd ever seen. Without realising
         it he had started to press his face against the glass of the window to get
         the best possible view, and this cause the mouse to turn around. He looked
         at the mouse, completely still and wide eyed...
