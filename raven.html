        <p>You know about werewolves right? Regular people most of the time, until
          the full moon comes along and they turn into wolves, limb by excruciating
          limb, like in those movies. Well, the Daughters of the Raven worship a
          deity who had similar power, but instead of turning into a wolf it turned
          into a huge raven.</p>
        <p>Other than that, same deal, normal lady rest of the time. She'd go around
          her worshipping communities gifting good luck, or bountiful crops or whatever
          else as she went. Then the full moon would come along and the transformation
          would occur. I imagine it was a bit less visceral than a werewolf transformation;
          almost beautiful, with feathers all over the place and beams of light and
          dark just like in the images.</p>
        <p>In her raven form, the goddess is meant to not deal out good luck, but take
          revenge on those who don't believe or who do any harm to her worshippers. From
          giver to defender.. but I don't believe in any of that stuff. Do you?
