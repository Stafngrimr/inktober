        <p>Fuzzy felt like the belle of the ball. Everyone wanted to talk to him, take
          a picture with him, shake his hand or just see it up close to compare the
          size.</p>
       <p>He had been working at the Marvelous Mike's Magical Circus for a few months
         now, and it was by far the best time of his life. Before this he was nothing
         but a monster to the world, feared and misunderstood. He was the only one
         of his kind as far as anyone knew, and it had taken him some years to convince
         the people of his kindness and softness.</p>
      <p>Marvelous Mike had given him an opportunity to continue to spread that word
        by joining the show and proving himself an asset and a friend to humankind.
        Everyone he met over the last few months of travelling loved him and wanted
        nothing more than to be his friend, and for that, he was ever grateful and
        promised himself that when his family arrived on earth, Marvelous Mike would be
        allowed to live unharmed.
