        <p>Princess Crystal wasn't born with her curse, but it slowly manifested
          over the years. It started when she was very young, and nobody can really answer
          definitively as to why; though there are theories..</p>
        <p>Being born into the royal family and waited upon hand and foot since birth
          gave Crystal something of a spoilt and impatient temperament. She was quick to anger,
          and wouldn't tolerate a word of critique or guidance from anyone. She was a
          cruel child, completely intolerant of any other human being around her. The
          crystalline skin did't take long to show itself, and her brittle nature was
          reflected in her face for all to see.</p>
        <p>Now she lives almost completely alone in her tower, having scared away anyone
          who might have wanted to spend time with her. She spends her days looking
          out from her balcony upon the rest of the world mingling, chatting, and
          living the life she could never have..
